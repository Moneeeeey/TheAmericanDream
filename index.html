            We as humans who live within society, have to blend in with other people in order to survive and thrive. But to what extent do we need to blend it and follow what other individuals do or believe?

            The Climate Crisis is an ongoing thing. Global warming also is something that cannot be stopped. Now one of the most important contributing factors to this matter is <b> waste </b>. The amount of waste that humans have. Especially in the US. We live in a country where Consumerism is a norm or rather a standard. But how and why did we get here as a country?        
        </p>
        <p>
            Looking at history, we can see how the idea of the “American Dream” and a lot of post-World War advertisements were based around indicating America as a free country, where each household has the power to buy and do whatever they want. 
Many years later, when looking at this topic now in 2024, with a huge wave of immigration to the United States, we see that the “American Dream” concept likely is not working anymore. Suppose we keep promising each person that they can make as much money as they want and obtain whatever they desire. In that case, we just end up adding to the consumer/capitalist cycle which just ends up with consumers wanting to spend more money on things that they don't necessarily need, which in this case just keeps adding to the cycle which in the long term created more goods that are not needed anymore, makes recycling significantly less effective, and keeps adding to the amount of waste that we have in the country. Adding to the fact that the population of the US is growing every year and most likely will not come to an end, the cycle of consumerism/capitalism is not going to be an efficient way to fight the climate crisis.

            Now throughout the years, designers have attempted to come up with a “potential” solution for consumerism. Some suggested “Green design” which now is the core value of most big companies. However, all the designs that claim they are environmentally friendly have no meaning.

Meaning as in that it really does not help the issue in deeper layers. It just “attempts” to solve the issue at the surface level. Like Nike or Apple making their products from recycled materials. On the surface level, it seems really good and effective. Nonetheless, when looking at it in the context of consumerism, this model does not change how consumers behave, rather it is just making the consumers feel better about their purchase. They are still purchasing more than what they need. The problem is not material or way of distribution. The problem is the consumerist mindset. The problem is that we live in a consumerism-based society, meaning that everywhere we go and whatever we do, it all goes back to spending habits and making more money to maintain the lifestyle we are looking for. There is however one thing about this, and it is that designers pose ideas about how as a society should change the consumerist/capitalist mindset and shift to a new society. I believe that it would never work. The United States of America became a consumerism-based country way back in the 1920s. With the advancement of technology and widespread advertising, every household in the country was pushed to purchase more.

            I personally oppose the idea of overthrowing consumerism and capitalism since it is something that has been the core of this country and society for more than 100 years now. Something that has lasted this long is quite unlikely to be overthrown or radically changed.

            Instead of trying to change the system as a whole, I believe that there are a few things that can be done to make this mental shift happen. 
        </p>

        <p>
            <b> Rhetoric </b>is one of the most valuable and important tools that humans have when it comes to communicating a point or idea to another person. Knowing that a good amount of designers usually use rhetorics through their art to communicate their ideas, I believe that one of the things that designers should do is use rhetorical devices to communicate ideas or simple messages that can teach or make a shift in the way that a group of people think about a subject. An example would be the slogan “Repair, Reuse, or Repurpose” which is interesting because it indicates the concept of regeneration and how people can be regenerative with the products and goods that they purchase. Therefore, I believe that designers should use such rhetoric in their graphic design or art pieces, not only make influence people and the community but also to raise awareness about 
        </p>

        <p> 
            Design with intention has to be the main tool that is needed for this change in my opinion. If we as designers want to make a change in this field. It either has to come down to ending consumerism, or designing products and goods that can not only last a long time but can actually make the user want to keep them forever. I belive that designs should incorporate the concept of emotional design in whatever they want to create. We know the fact that living in a consumerist community means that people will end up buying goods, but it all comes down to how many different versions of the same good are needed. I have a personal experience with this one. The backpack that I use daily has been with me since I was 12 years old. It is a huge black backpack with a lot of space (camera storage, as well as laptop storage). It also holds water bottles, is expandable, and happens to fit right under my seat on an airplane. For me, this was an amazing product. I never in my life owned a second backpack. This is where we see how emotional design helped me use the same product for more than 9 years and I will probably end up using the same backpack until I die. Therefore designers have to understand the power that their design has on the people.
        </p>

        <p>
            Setting the right policies is the last thing I feel is needed to make this mental shift. We as humans all know that certain things are bad for us, but we end up doing them. It is like humans to do things that are not necessarily good for them. This is where rules and regulations come in handy. It is as if sometimes humans need to be forced to do certain things or be forced not to do other things for them to be able to survive. In my opinion, the same thing is applicable to design for consumerism. This is the side that we as designers are not necessarily designing something, but we should be advocating for change and policy making. Now as a designer, you can advocate in several different ways. It can be through a poster, an art installation, or as part of an advertisement on a billboard. It does not matter. What matters is the message. 
        </p>

        <p> 
            Overall, coming up with one solid solution for this deeply rooted issue of consumerism is not likely possible, however using a combination of approaches that blends intentional design, rhetorical influence, emotional attention, and policy advocacy might be the way to go. Designers have to understand the power that they have to shape societal behavior by incorporating these ideas in their designs and products, which can lead to the rise of awareness, regeneration culture, and mindfulness when it comes to purchasing goods. While destroying consumerism altogether may be very unrealistic, using design to shift the system's thinking and the community’s mindset toward considerate consumption is very much achievable.
